This notebook provides a ready-to-run setup for training imitation learning policies using the [ü§ó LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) library.\n","\n","In this example, we train an `ACT` policy using a dataset hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), and optionally track training metrics with [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai/).\n","\n","## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements\n","- A Hugging Face dataset repo ID containing your training data (`--dataset.repo_id=YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_DATASET`)\n","- Optional: A [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) account if you want to enable training visualization\n","- Recommended: GPU runtime (e.g., NVIDIA A100) for faster training\n","\n","## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Training Time\n","Training with the `ACT` policy for 100,000 steps typically takes **about 1.5 hours on an NVIDIA A100** GPU. On less powerful GPUs or CPUs, training may take significantly longer.\n","\n","## Example Output\n","Model checkpoints, logs, and training plots will be saved to the specified `--output_dir`. If `wandb` is enabled, progress will also be visualized in your wandb project dashboard.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MOJyX0CnwA5m"},"source":["## Install conda\n","This cell uses
